# la-county-parks
Could refresh or add based on recently released county data http://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2016/07/07/park-needs-assessment/

There are also a lot of parks listed as nodes in OpenStreetMap that could be drawn or imported.

## Next steps
1. Compare OSM data to county data (using QGIS and Overpass turbo)
2. Possibly create a MapRoulette challenge asking for a trace of any node marked leisure=park
3. Possibly use the county's feature tilelayer to help define perimeters of park.
